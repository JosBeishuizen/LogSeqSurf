- Manuscript D-24-00986 entitled "Mapping the Landscape of Science Learning in Informal Environments from 2009 to 2024: A Review of the Literature Using Topic Modeling" uses the technique of structural topic modeling (STM) to summarize the findings of 552 papers on informal science learning. The topic is relevant for the Jourmal. The paper has been clearly written and well structured. However, several issues lead me to the advice to reject the paper. My problems can be summarized in four major issues.
- Informal science learning is a well researched topic, both from an educational perspective and a broader cultural point of view, e.g. museum learning. However, the current manuscript does not provide a well documented insight in our current  understanding of informal science learning. One paper is introduced, the 2009 National Research Council report. This study proposes a Strands of Science Learning Framework which "serves as an organizing framework for the areas and aspects of science learning that are characteristics of informal learning environments and has important implications for practice and research" (p. 4). However, the "organizing" function of the framework is not clear in the rest of the paper. Moreover, the readers are not informed about previous reviews which are relevant for the current endeavour. These reviews do exist. A very brief exploration with Google Scholar does produce various points of departure, like Hussim, H., Rosli, R., Nor, N. A. Z. M., Maat, S. M., Mahmud, M. S., Iksan, Z., ... & Lay, A. N. (2024). A Systematic Literature Review of Informal STEM Learning. European Journal of STEM Education, 9(1), 7..

- As a consequence of the first issue, the current manuscript does not provide a clear overview of what we know and do not know about informal science learning. The research questions do not specify problems which have to solved by research in the domain of interest. Rather, the research questions call for a description of themes to be further explored. This problem can be solved by a more in-depth analysis of the current research on informal science learning and by presenting urgent questions for which a solution might be found in recent literature.

- The authors have chosen an inductive statistical technique, structural topic modeling, to scrutinize the collected papers, that is, the abstracts of the collected papers. The choice of this technique is again a consequence of the first issue, the lack of theoretical embedding of the review. This reviewer considers the lengthy explanation of the technique is inappropriate for the general review journal. The authors seem to try to defend the use of this technique for reviewing purposes. For instance, the graphs in Figure 5 do not add substantially to explanation of the trends over the years in attention for the various topics. It would be my preference to embark on such a project in a more technically oriented journal.

- In my view, the outcomes of the STM effort are rather modest. The list of opportunities for informal science learning in Table 3 and on p. 21/22, "news media and science; family science engagement; after-school science; online science learning; museum learning; chemistry education and science outreach; science centers; social media and science" could be easily created without conducting the review and applying the STM procedure. Again, this is a consequence of omitting a thorough analysis of what we know and do not know about informal science learning.
